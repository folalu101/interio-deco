                            <p>Designed for a technology company that has been in the cloud solutions business for over 10years, the office spans across a 330square meter area in a uniquely shaped building on Lagos Island.  The uniqueness of the building structure presented us with an opportunity to create a modern interior that respected the building’s existing shape</p>

                            <p>Operating for more than 7 years, we are bringing back the beauty of African inspired furniture to homes within Nigeria. The Simplinteriors product range is ever expanding to encompass different styles, finishes and even different finishes of wood. The original aims and values still hold true: to offer high quality, beautiful and uniquely designed furniture, lighting and accessories – handmade from natural materials and sourced with the environment in mind.</p>
                            <h3 class="pd2">Exclusive handcrafted designs</h3>
                            <p>Beautiful, individual furniture doesn’t happen by chance. It’s the human element, the careful hand finishing by skilled craftsmen that gives Simplinteriors furniture such a personal feel and ensures that you will not find our products anywhere else in the world. It’s hard to believe just how much care and attention goes into producing a single piece of simplinteriors furniture.

                                Numerous stages are required to construct and finish each item by hand to the highest standards. It’s the individual, loved and reassuringly lived in feel of our furniture that really sets us apart.
                                
                                When it comes to our upholstered furniture such as our sumptuous sofas and chairs or the mattresses we sell which carry a Royal seal of approval, we work with Nigerian suppliers that are as dedicated to quality as we are. After all – you don’t have to travel far to get the best in the world.</p>
